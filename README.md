=================

This repo contains the code used for the submitted manuscript

Install the KDE EBM
============
Once inside this directly you can just install with `pip` using

`pip install .`


Dependencies
============
- [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy)
- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
- [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib)
- [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

The code depends heavily on NumPy, uses SciPy to calculate some stats and do some optimisation, uses Matplotlib just to do the plotting, and used scikit-learn to do some Kernel Density Estimation
